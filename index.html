      Home coffee roasting is a terrific way to ensure fresh beans for your
      daily cup of joe—and if there is one thing coffee lovers agree on, it is
      that fresher means better. Experts say coffee beans are best used between
      two to 14 days after roasting.Roaster options are fairly limited,
      especially compared to other coffee-related appliances like grinders and
      milk frothers, but the process itself is simple and takes just minutes.
      The two main kinds of rosters are manual and automatic, both of which are
      covered on this list. The former is more affordable but likely has a
      smaller capacity; the latter is easier to use and typically includes
      electric or gas devices.

      Simply put, “French roast” describes the color of the coffee beans after
      they have been roasted. These beans are on the darker end of the scale,
      and are usually the color of dark chocolate. It does not mean the coffee
      was grown or roasted in France (although yes, that is where the roasting
      style originated in the 1800s).The name is believed to reflect the tastes
      and traditions of coffee roasters in Europe in the 19th century, where
      dark roasted coffee was all the rage. Italian roast, or espresso roast,
      was nearly as dark as French, and Vienna roast a staple of the Viennese
      cafes and pastry shops known for their great coffee was slightly lighter
      than Italian roast. But the French proudly took the honors as the darkest
      roast of all.

      Colombian coffee is coffee that has been grown in the various departments
      within Colombia. It is not its own variety of coffee bean. Colombian
      coffee is prized for its excellent flavour and aroma as almost all the
      coffee grown is of the arabican variety. Coffee packets that have been
      labelled as Colombian coffee may be a blend of various coffees from
      throughout Colombia or a single origin. Single-origin Colombian coffee is
      coffee that has been produced by and traceable from one single farm or
      cooperative in Colombia.
