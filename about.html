      It is not known exactly when coffee as a drink was discovered. However, we
      do know that the coffee plant originated in Ethiopia, where coffee beans
      were consumed either as a paste or as a drink, for their medicinal
      properties. The shrub was introduced to Yemen around the 14th century and
      it was then that the first coffee plantations were created. Muslim mystics
      and pilgrims appreciated coffee for its energising powers, so it travelled
      to Mecca. From that moment onwards, its success became unstoppable,
      bowling over Cairo, the Middle East and Constantinople, before arriving in
      Europe in the early 17th century. As expected, this new drink would come
      up against a few opponents. Religious clerics were suspicious and asked
      Pope Clement VIII to taste it. He allegedly declared that it would be a
      sin if only unbelievers were allowed to enjoy such a delicious drink. Like
      the pope, the privileged classes were charmed by coffee and quickly
      embraced its exoticism; turqueries were particularly fashionable at that
      time. Intellectuals appreciated it for its ability to help one stay alert
      and to think clearly. Unlike chocolate, which remained a luxury for the
      privileged for a long time, coffee, which was less-expensive, was adopted
      by all levels of society and welcomed into homes during the 19th century.
      A morning cup of coffee gradually replaced traditional broths or soups and
      became established as a great classic.The arrival of coffee was
      accompanied by a new trend as establishments serving coffee, just like the
      ones that existed in Constantinople and in Cairo, began to open all over
      Europe. They soon became meeting places, where people from a variety of
      backgrounds could get together, discuss and exchange ideas, without
      becoming intoxicated. In Paris, for example, Le Procope (which still
      exists) became a meeting place for artists and intellectuals - Montesquieu
      and Diderot were regular customers. The freedom of speech and the spirit
      of revolt which sometimes reigned in these establishments did not go
      unnoticed by the authorities. In London, caf√©s came to be considered
      dangerous and, in 1676, Charles II ordered their closure. However, as a
      result of public pressure, they reopened just a few days later.Changes in
      the way coffee was made no doubt contributed to the drinks growing
      success. When coffee arrived in Europe, water and ground beans were boiled
      together, in the Turkish style. However, the Viennese were unimpressed by
      its coarse texture and thus had the idea of filtering out the grounds.
      This proved an immediate hit and the idea of filter coffee makers soon
      developed. Pressurised coffee machines, using steam to moisten the
      grounds, arrived on the scene later and became equally as successful.An
      old tale tells the story of a young goat herder in Yemen, called Kaldi who
      was astonished to see his herd of goats become particularly excited when
      they ate certain red berries. He picked some of these berries and took
      them to the local monastery. The Prior used them to make a brew, which he
      drank, and found that he remained incredibly alert during evening prayers:
      thus coffee became a beverage. While the story may be historically
      dubious, it nevertheless proves interesting as it highlights one of coffee
      is great attractions: its stimulating effect.
